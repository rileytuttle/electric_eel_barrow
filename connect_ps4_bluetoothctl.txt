    sudo bluetoothctl
    agent on
    discoverable on
    pairable on
    default-agent

    scan on

    connect D0:27:88:69:58:9A // my specific controller


possibly will need to remove the controller first

    remove D0:27:88:69:58:9A

need to make a script that automagically does this when we are not connected. or on boot up or something.

use expect script and connect to anything that registers as a new wireless controller


if ps4 controller connecting and then disconnecting follow these instructions

go to /lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service

change the following lines
    ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd
to
    ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --noplugin=sap

then go to /lib/systemd/system/bthelper@.service

replace

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/bthelper %I

NOTE: mine used to be Type=oneshot
with 

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 2
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/bthelper %I
    ExecStartPost=sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart

then reboot and going through the bluetoothctl steps should work


to see ds4 battery level
    cat /sys/class/power_supply/sony_controller_batter...../capacity

in docker
    make sure to start the dbus
        >> /etc/init.d/dbus start
    and start the bluetooth daemon
        >> /usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd --debug &
