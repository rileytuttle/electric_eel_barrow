see https://siytek.com/arduino-cli-raspberry-pi/ for uploading arduino from cli

for platform not installed error run
arduino-cli core install arduino:avr

see https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/B45i/getting-started-with-arduino-cli-7652a5

so the flow is
    arduino-cli board list
that will show the port (/dev/ttyACM0) or something like that
    arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:uno <sketch_name>
that will compile
then we need to upload
    arduino-cli upload -p <port> --fqbn arduino:avr:uno <sketch_name>
if it says I don't have permission then run as sudo
    sudo path/to/arduino-cli upload -p <port> --fqbn arduino:avr:uno <sketch_name>

path to at the moment is $HOME/electric_eel_barrow/bin/arduino-cli

to see serial monitor run
    sudo screen /dev/ttyACM0 <baud>
then use ctrl-a ctrl-\
